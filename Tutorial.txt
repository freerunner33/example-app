Here's a short tutorial that should get you writing apps in no time! YAAAAY


// Create the files and folders for your app on your computer first //

	1. Make a new folder on your computer

	2. Open Sublime and open this folder

	3. Create js folder, css folder and images folder

	4. Create index.html and config.xml
		-These files are in main folder

	5. Create style.css in css folder
		-This file can be blank

	6. Create app.js and jquery.js in js folder
		-copy code for latest jquery (found at https://code.jquery.com) into jquery.js
		-get the minified one (removes spaces and stuff)

	7. Create icon.png file in image folder
		-if you don't create an icon file, a default icon will be used
		-maximim resolution is 512 x 512


// Next create a github repository //

	1. Create account on https://github.com/ if you don't have an account

	2. At top of home page, click 'Create New' -> 'New Repository'

	3. Give your repository a name, and then click 'Create Repository'


// Now link your repository to your local code //

	1. Open terminal or CMD and change directories to your folder
		-The folder with index.html and all the other stuff
		-To change directory type cd followed by names of folders
			'cd /' will go to your top folder
			'cd ..' goes up a folder
			type 'ls' in terminal to view the folders and files within the current folder
			type 'dir' on CMD

	2. Once you're at your main folder type the following
		git init
			-This initializes a git repository
		git add -A
			-This adds all folders and files
		git commit -m "First commit. Woooo"
			-This adds a message to your commit
		git remote add origin https://github.com/freerunner33/example-app.git
			-This links to your github repository
			-Be sure to change the username and repository name
				-Find these on your github repository page online
		git push origin master
			-This pushes all the files through to your github repository
			-Check online if this worked on your github


// Phonegap time //

	1. Why phonegap? 
		-If you know how to code a webpage, you can build the app in the same way, and have your app build
			for iOS, Android or Windows OS platforms
		-Web languages are easy for graphical stuff so just use Phonegap!

	2. Sign up or sign in somehow on http://build.phonegap.com/

	3. At your home page click the '+ new app' button

	4. Go find your github link thing and paste it in the box on Phonegap
		-https://github.com/freerunner33/example-app.git


// Put code into files //

	1. For the config.xml go online to see starting template at build.phonegap.com under Config-The Basics
		-http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/configuring_basics.md.html

	2. Change id, add target OS and modify other fields of the config
		-See my example config.xml

	3. Open up index.html and fill in with basic html code
		-Add headers and basic text elements
		-Important in head add the following line
			<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'>
		-Also make sure to link in your style sheet in head
		-At bottom of body make sure to link the following js files
			app.js, jquery.js, phonegap.js
			-phonegap.js is necessary to link, but you do not write the file


// Build your code to an app //

	1. Navigate back to your home page on Phonegap and under the app you created, click 'Ready to Build'

	2. Wait a few seconds and the app will appear built at the bottom

	3. Download the app in any of the following ways
		1. Navigate to https://build.phonegap.com/apps/
			Click your app, then download onto your phone
		2. Download app onto your computer and move file onto phone
		3. Use QR code scanner to scan QR code and obtain download

	4. Once downloaded you should open it on your phone. You might run into walls here:
		-Install blocked: For security, your phone is set to block installation....
			-Go to your phone's security settings and allow installation of apps from sources
				other than the Play Store
		-Any other issues, please check your code for errors. If you open index.html in a browser, it
			should display in the same way that it would on your phone, just bigger. This is a good 
			test of your code
